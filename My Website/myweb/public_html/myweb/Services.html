                                        From the earliest days of my childhood, a profound love for computer, console, and mobile games 
                                        has been a driving force in my life. This passion crystallized as I delved into the realm of 
                                        Information Technology, leading me to a resolute decision – <strong>I wanted to be a game developer</strong>. 
                                        A pivotal moment in this journey unfolded during our thesis project, where I conceived an innovative 
                                        game-like app that offered a captivating 3D exploration of our campus. This endeavor marked my 
                                        initiation into the intricate world of game engines, with Unity emerging as the cornerstone of my 
                                        creative endeavors. <br><br>

                                        <strong>Unity Engine</strong>, a cutting-edge game development platform, became the conduit through which I transformed my 
                                        visionary ideas into tangible, interactive experiences. Its robust features, cross-platform 
                                        capabilities, and intuitive interface allowed me to navigate the complexities of game development 
                                        seamlessly. As I honed my skills with Unity 3D, my thesis project not only achieved success 
                                        academically but also became a catalyst for personal and professional growth. The experience taught 
                                        me invaluable lessons about perseverance and pushing oneself beyond limits – qualities essential in 
                                        the dynamic field of game development. <br><br>
